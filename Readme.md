# Chip-8 Interpreter in Rust.

## What's CHIP-8?

Chip 8 is a simple programming language used during the late 70's / early 80's. Since this is my first emulator, I wanted to work with a simple instruction set, and the CHIP-8 seems to fit the bill.

Everything I know about the CHIP-8, I learned from [Cowgod](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).

There's a lot of work to do before this is in a working state. The code needs to be refactored, sound and delay timers aren't fully implemented, and a nicer UI would be cool.
